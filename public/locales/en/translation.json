    "about_text": "Hello, I'm Enes. ðŸš€ I'm a Full-Stack Developer who builds modern and user-centric web applications. I focus on bridging the gap between aesthetic user interfaces that users enjoy interacting with, and the robust server-side logic that brings them to life. As you can see in this portfolio, I am capable of developing a product from start to finish, combining the power of React and the type-safety of TypeScript with the flexibility of Node.js. I've adopted the principle of transforming complex problems into clean, readable, and maintainable code. My greatest goal is to continuously improve by learning new technologies and to be part of projects that create tangible value with these skills.",
